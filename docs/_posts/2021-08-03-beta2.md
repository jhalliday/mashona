As the [JDK 17](http://jdk.java.net/17/) release cycle hits release candidate stage ahead of the expected GA next month, so too is mashona taking the final steps towards its 1.0 release.

The 1.0 Beta2 of the [logwriting](https://github.com/jhalliday/mashona/tree/main/logwriting) module out today
brings code enhancements and changes to the [debug/trace logging](https://mashona.io/blog/2021/04/12/debug-logging).
Feature work for 1.0 is now complete and the 1.0.GA release should follow shortly after the JDK 17 GA in September.

The next few weeks are a good time for both testing the 1.0 version in your apps and to submit feature requests for the 1.1 development cycle.
