The start of 2021 marks a new phase for the project, with the first Beta release out now.

The 1.0 Beta1 release of the [logwriting](https://github.com/jhalliday/mashona/tree/main/logwriting) module is now ready for integration with JVM based applications seeking to benefit from the fast write performance of persistent memory.

Providing a variety of binary logging APIs for different use cases, including a drop-in replacement for Java's FileChannel, the open source library already shows some impressive benchmarks numbers for use cases in

and

use cases.

We're sure the community will find many more applications that can benefit and we're looking forward to feedback from the early adopters. 2021 should be an interesting year!
